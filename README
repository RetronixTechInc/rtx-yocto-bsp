i.MX Repo Manifest README 

This repo is used to download manifests for i.MX BSP releases.

The branch will be based on the release type Linux or Android with release manifests in each branch tied to the base releases.

-----------------------------------------
Note: The remaining instructions are for setting up a BSP release only. For setting

$: [MACHINE=<machine>] [DISTRO=<distro>] source sources/meta-rtx-arm/tool/rtx-setup-release.sh -b bld-<backend>

<machine> defaults to imx8mm_cse

<backend>   Graphics backend type
xwayland    Wayland with X11 support - default distro
wayland     Wayland
x11         X11  (not supported for mx8)
